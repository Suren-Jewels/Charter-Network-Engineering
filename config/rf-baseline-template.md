# 📡 RF Baseline Template  
**Signal levels • Noise thresholds • Plant performance**

This template defines the baseline RF metrics used to evaluate plant health and customer‑facing performance.

---

## 📉 Downstream Baseline (dBmV)
- Ideal range: –7 to +7  
- Acceptable range: –10 to +10  
- SNR target: ≥ 38 dB  

---

## 🔼 Upstream Baseline (dBmV)
- Ideal range: 40–45  
- Acceptable range: 35–50  
- MER target: ≥ 35 dB  

---

## 🔍 Noise & Ingress Thresholds
- Ingress spikes: < –20 dBmV  
- OFDMA noise floor: < –25 dBmV  
- No persistent narrowband interference

## 📝 Notes
Use this baseline to compare against field measurements and identify deviations requiring corrective action.
