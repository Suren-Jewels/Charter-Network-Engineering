# DOCSIS Tuning Workflow

## Objective
Optimize signal quality and reduce repeat service calls.

## Steps
1. Connect field meter to customer drop line.
2. Measure downstream/upstream SNR and power levels.
3. Adjust amplifier gain to maintain -10 to +10 dBmV range.
4. Verify modulation profile (QAM256 downstream, QPSK upstream).
5. Document readings in RF log for reproducibility.
