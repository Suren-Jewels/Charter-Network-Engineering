## 📡 Downstream Levels (dBmV)

| Channel | Frequency | Level | SNR |
|---------|-----------|--------|------|
| 1 | 573 MHz | +2.1 | 38.7 dB |
| 2 | 579 MHz | +1.8 | 38.5 dB |
| 3 | 585 MHz | +1.5 | 38.2 dB |
| 4 | 591 MHz | +1.2 | 38.0 dB |

**Notes:**  
- Slight tilt observed across downstream channels  
- Levels remain within acceptable operational range

## 🔼 Upstream Levels (dBmV)

| Channel | Frequency | Power |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | 36 MHz | 43.5 |
| 2 | 29 MHz | 44.0 |
| 3 | 22 MHz | 44.5 |

**Notes:**  
- Upstream power trending high  
- Potential upstream noise or plant attenuation

## 🔍 Spectrum Observations

- Minor ingress detected around 27–29 MHz  
- No significant suck‑outs  
- OFDMA block stable  
- No intermittent spikes during 60‑second capture

## 📝 Technician Notes

- Replaced corroded F‑connector at ground block  
- Adjusted splitter configuration inside premises  
- Post‑tuning upstream power reduced by ~2 dB  
- Customer confirmed service stability after adjustments
