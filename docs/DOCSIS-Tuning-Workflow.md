# 🔧 DOCSIS Tuning Workflow  
**Signal optimization • Modem stability • CMTS alignment**

This workflow provides a standardized procedure for tuning DOCSIS performance during field operations.

---

## 1. Pre‑Tuning Checks
- Validate physical installation  
- Confirm modem online status  
- Review upstream/downstream levels  
- Check SNR and MER  

---

## 2. Spectrum Analysis
- Identify ingress  
- Detect suck‑outs or tilt  
- Validate OFDM/OFDMA profiles  
- Confirm no upstream noise spikes  

---

## 3. Corrective Actions
- Replace damaged connectors or coax  
- Adjust splitters or tap ports  
- Correct signal imbalance  
- Remove noise sources  

---

## 4. DOCSIS Layer Validation
- Confirm modem bonding  
- Validate CMTS registration  
- Check profile stability  
- Review modem logs  

---

## 5. Final Verification
- Run throughput tests  
- Validate SNR/MER  
- Confirm customer service restoration  
- Document tuning results
